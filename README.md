# BookClubVersion1
A basic book club application using Java Collections and Classes

This application covers basic features of a Book Manager and User. 
Manager can do functions like add a new user, add a new book, delete a book, view all books, view ratings etc.
User can perform functions like add a review, update a review, delete a review, etc.

This is just a basic project to understand and practice the concepts. And thus I have referred it as Version 1, 
as I'll build full version of this same concept using many other java concepts. Or I might have poste by the time you rea this.
